# Cancer genetics and genomics

1. Using cell biochemistry and genetic engineered mouse models to study the function of novel cancer related genes, including C7orf24/GGCT and others.  

1. Cancer genomic study to identify novel features and novel driving alterations for cancer evolution, with a specific focus on the function of non-coding DNA elements. 

1. Systematic study to identify biomarkers for cancer immunotherapy. See recent publication from our lab: Wang S, Jia M, He Z, Liu XS. APOBEC3B and APOBEC mutational signature as potential predictive markers for immunotherapy response in non-small cell lung cancer. Oncogene. 2018. 

1. Genetic engineered mouse model to faithfully mimic human cancer. CRISPR biotechniques enable us to generate multiple genetic alterations in somatic cell simultaneously to mimic real human cancer, which are usually driving by 4-5 genetic alterations.
