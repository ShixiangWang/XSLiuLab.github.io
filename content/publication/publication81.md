abstract = "How cells adapt to oncogenic transformation-associated cellular stress and become fully transformed is still unknown. Here we identified a novel GGCT-regulated glutathione (GSH)-reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolic pathway in oncogenic stress alleviation. We identified GGCT as a target of oncogenic Ras and that it is required for oncogenic Ras-induced primary mouse cell proliferation and transformation and in vivo lung cancer formation in the LSL-Kras G12D mouse model. However, GGCT deficiency is compatible with normal mouse development, suggesting that GGCT can be a cancer-specific therapeutic target. Genetically amplified GGCT locus further supports the oncogenic driving function of GGCT. In summary, our study not only identifies an oncogenic function of GGCT but also identifies a novel regulator of GSH metabolism, with implications for further understanding of oncogenic stress and cancer treatment."
